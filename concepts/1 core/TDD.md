# junit

use the BDD (behavior driven design) style to describe tests:

    givenState_whenMethodUnderTest_thenExpectedResult
        // given
        // when
        // then

write all assertions test a method that throws an exception

write tests using all lifecycle steps (before, after)

write a parameterized test

# assertj

use as many fluent assertions as possible

# TDD
